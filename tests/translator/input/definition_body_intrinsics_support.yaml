Description: >
  DefinitionBody currently only supports intrinsics when SwaggerEditor/OpenApiEditor
  is not used (as of 2022-05-30).
  Let's add tests to make sure we keep this support, because we've had a regression
  where we accidentally
  removed this intrinsics support by using the SwaggerEditor.
  Note that the only supported intrinsic function for DefinitionBody is Fn::If. Other
  intrinsics are not supported
  because they don't resolve to dictionary. 

Conditions:
  FalseCondition:
    Fn::Equals:
    - true
    - false
