# For Implicit APIs, StageName is automatically set by SAM. Due to a limitation of the current architecture,
# StageName **cannot** be overridden for Implicit APIs.
#
# This test captures this behavior and serves as a reminder for us to fix this future

Globals:
  Api:
    Name: "some api"

    # This stage name will *not* be reflected in Implicit API
